FRC 9577's Template Repository for Robot Code

# How to use this template
This repositry is a github template repository. It represents the baseline code that FRC 9577 uses for our robots, including dependencies we use in our designs. To use our code, create a repository using this one as a template.

# What does in this template and what doesn't
This template repo should not contain any tools. Starting with a git clone, this repo provides all the scripting and build necessary to start an environment from scratch. The only required tools are VSCode and Git. (Currently the end-to-end flow for the installers is WIP)

# Updating this template
When a new version of tools or libraries becomes available, use the WPILIB VSCode plugin to update the files in the project. Then, open a pull request against main to merge your change in.

Sometimes there are updates not serviced by the WPILib plugin. In these cases, make the changes using editors and push the results to github.
